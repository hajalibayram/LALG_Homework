Before running make sure you have "edges_file_python" inside the code directory
 
The following packages of python are needed for execution:
	matplotlib
	numpy
	scipy
	copy

Run main.py script and all of the results will be generated in the command line, and the figures will be reproduced.

Alternatively, you can run the notebook 'pagerank.ipynb' from the beginning.
