The following packages of python are needed for execution:
	matplotlib
	numpy
	sklearn
	open-cv (cv2)
	PIL
	scipy
	imageio

Run the scripts main_clustering.py and main_video.py and all of the results will be generated for the clustering and video background removal, respectively.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks hw3_video.ipynb or hw3_clustering  from the beginning.
